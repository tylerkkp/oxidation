# oxidation

### Purpose

This is my playground for testing out new things. I like Python a lot, but it can be slow relative to some other languages. Rust, by comparison, is very fast. There are multiple case studies showing huge increases in performance for large scale applications. Dropbox, Figma, and Microsoft have all moved some of their codebase to Rust and seen huge increases in performance.

I got myself a copy of [The Rust Programming Language]{https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/} and am currently working through the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) over in a separate repository - 'learning_rust'.
